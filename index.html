                <p>
                    For anyone who hasn’t been following the Detroit Tigers this season, here I will tell you my thoughts about the team as the regular season has concluded and we are getting ready for the postseason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year, the Tigers made a historic run at the end of the season to make the playoffs and make it through the first round. That was cut short by our rivals, the Cleveland Guardians. This year, we continued that hot run by having the best record in MLB by the All-Star break. Up 14.5 games in our division, the largest lead in MLB at the time, and here we are at the end of the regular season, 2nd in the division! The team that finished first is the Cleveland Guardians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, to start the playoffs, we get to play the Guardians AGAIN! We finished the season playing 2 series against them in the span of 2 weeks, and we are playing them again. Not to mention, WE SUCK AGAINST THEM! I will say that I am not very optimistic about our odds of winning this series. At the beginning of the year, I was looking towards the World Series; now I’m just happy that we even made the playoffs.

                <h2>My Take on the Detroit Lions</h2>

                <p>
                    This post is where I will talk about the BRAND NEW DETROIT LIONS. If you aren’t aware, I say brand new because of an old saying that people say, “Same Old Lions.” This is a saying because… the Lions tend to SUCK! But we forget about all that because the Lions are good now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since Dan Campbell came in as the head coach, there has been a different vibe in Detroit. He came in with the intention of changing the culture here in Detroit. He wanted the team's identity to match that of the city. From what we can see right now, it has worked. These Lions are gritty just like our city, and that starts with MCDC (Motor City Dan Campbell)! After two big seasons the past 2 years, can they keep it going and finally win a Super Bowl?
                </p>
                <p>
                    My honest take is no. I don’t see a Super Bowl in the near future, especially this year. While yes, we have been playing very well, I just don’t see it happening with the gauntlet of a schedule we face. Our upcoming schedule has us playing the past two Super Bowl champions in the Chiefs and Eagles, while also playing solid Buccaneers, Vikings, and Commanders teams. I hope they prove me wrong, but I just don’t know.
