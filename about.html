        Hello! My name is Logan Sculer, and I am the author behind this blog. I have a passion for sports, specifically Detroit/Michigan sports, and I love sharing my thoughts and insights with fellow enthusiasts. Whether it's breaking down game strategies, analyzing player performances, or discussing team dynamics, I aim to provide engaging and thoughtful content for my readers.

        When I'm not writing, you can usually find me playing these sports with my friends or just watching them on TV.
    </p>
    <p>Here are a few fun facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have ran a milk mile beacuse I suck at March Madness.</li>
        <li>I played baseball at Hope College my freshman year.</li>
        <li>I can eat a tub of ice cream in one sitting.</li>
    </ul>

        Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you find inspiration, helpful tips, and maybe even a new favorite hobby while you're here!
